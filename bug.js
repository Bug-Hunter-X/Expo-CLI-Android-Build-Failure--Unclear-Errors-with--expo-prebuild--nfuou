This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android build system and the `expo prebuild` command. The error message itself might not be very clear, often mentioning issues with the build process or dependencies.  The root cause is typically related to conflicts or problems within the `android/` folder of your Expo project, such as incorrect configuration or missing dependencies.
