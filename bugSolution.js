The solution involves a systematic approach:

1. **Clean the Android build:** Execute `./gradlew clean` within the `android/` directory of your Expo project.
2. **Examine the Detailed Build Logs:**  The complete error message provides crucial clues.  Carefully review the log for error messages indicating missing dependencies, version conflicts, or configuration problems. 
3. **Check Android Dependencies:** Verify that all Android dependencies (specified in `android/build.gradle` and other relevant files) are correctly defined and their versions are compatible.  Resolve any conflicts by updating or removing conflicting dependencies.
4. **Check Android Configuration:** Inspect your `android/app/build.gradle` and other Android-related configuration files for any potential errors or inconsistencies. Pay close attention to settings related to SDK versions, build tools, and dependencies.
5. **Reinstall node_modules:** Sometimes this fixes things, particularly if there were issues installing dependencies
6. **Reinstall the Expo CLI:** If you still experience problems, try reinstalling the Expo CLI. 
7. **Update Expo CLI:**  Make sure you're running the latest version of the Expo CLI using `npm install -g expo-cli`

Example Code (`bugSolution.js`):  This doesn't contain a direct solution as the nature of the bug varies; instead, the code focus is on error-handling improvements to facilitate problem-solving:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative example)
expo.Android.buildAsync().catch(error => {
  console.error('Android build failed:', error);
  console.log('Detailed error information:', error.stack);
});
```
This improved error handling provides more context when the build fails.
